"""Word Break [Medium]

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 300
* 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
* 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
* s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
* All the strings of wordDict are unique.

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n^2) time and O(n) space, where n is the length of s: the canonical DP tries a split at every earlier position against a set of the dictionary words, and the statement caps a word at 20 characters so each comparison is a constant factor.
