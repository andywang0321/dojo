"""
Daily Temperatures [Medium]

You are given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.
Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day. If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [30,38,30,36,35,40,28]
Output: [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [22,21,20]
Output: [0,0,0]

Constraints:
1 <= temperatures.length <= 1000.
1 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
