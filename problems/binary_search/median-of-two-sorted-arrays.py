"""Median of Two Sorted Arrays [Hard]

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Constraints:
* nums1.length == m
* nums2.length == n
* 0 <= m <= 1000
* 0 <= n <= 1000
* 1 <= m + n <= 2000
* -10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(log n) time and O(1) space, where n is the total number of elements in the two arrays: the intended search runs in O(log min(m, n)), which is at least as good.
